# WordFinder

#### Counts instances of a Word in Sentence, 2016-02-19_

#### By _**Nic Netzel**_

## Description

_User enters a word to find and a sentence to search. The app returns the number of times that word occurs within the sentence._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the Repository_
* _in your terminal, run  "composer install"   to get silex and twig_
* _start your php sever in the "web" folder_



## Known Bugs

_In its non-Regular Expression version it will only match an exact (albeit case insensitive) string, not the actual "word" ignoring punctuation.

The ability to include Plural words only really works in the case of words that are pluralized simply by adding an S. so it's not a true Plural search_
